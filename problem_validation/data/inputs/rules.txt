The system models user interaction with a mobile application composed of multiple screens.

At any time, the user is located on exactly one screen.
Each screen may contain visible UI targets and visible input fields.

Navigation rules:
- If a target is visible on the current screen and defines a transition, clicking it moves the user to another screen.
- Some targets may support double-tap or long-press transitions.
- Dragging between two visible targets may trigger a screen transition.
- Scrolling in a direction may move to another screen.
- The user may navigate back if a back-link exists between screens.
- The user may always navigate to the home screen.

Focus rules:
- At most one input field can be focused at any time.
- A field can only be focused if it is visible on the current screen.
- When the screen changes, any focused field is cleared.

Text rules:
- Text can only be entered into a field when that field is focused.
- Text can only be entered if the text is ready.
- After text is entered, the field stores that text.

Task rules:
- The system may ask the user for information.
- The system may answer using prepared text.
- When a final status is set, the task is finalized and no further actions are allowed.

Cost:
- Every action increases the total execution cost by one.
